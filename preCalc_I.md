**Section I: Representing and Classifying Functions**

This is our introductory material.  Here, we want to remind students about the vocabulary of *functions* as a process of describing the 
interconnectedness of quantities.  We are not interested in the theory of functions, having students decide whether or not something is a function,
or memorization of a formal definition of a function.  Instead, we want to focus on representation of interrelatedness of quantities
in words, graphs, tables, and mathematical symbols.  Our primary goals in this section might be:

- Support students facility in moving between representations of functions
- Use Jupyter Notebooks to represent functions with words in markdown cells
- Use Jupyter Notebooks to represent functions with graphs with Python in matplotlib
- Use Jupyter Notebooks to represent functions with tables with Python in Pandas
- Use Jupyter Notebooks to represent functions with symbols with Python in Sympy
- Discriminate between Linear, Quadratic, Exponential, and Trigonometric Functions

### Materials

Here are some draft notebooks in the order that we've discussed problems this semester.  We are in the process of revising these materials, and they
are not meant to necessarily be used in presented order.

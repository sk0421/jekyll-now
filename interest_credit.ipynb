How long will this take?\n",

His parents are unwilling to pay it back for him however, and he will have to pay the credit card company Annual Interest Rate of 21.4%, compounded monthly.  He has a decent job and is also able to pay \\$200 per month.  How long will this take?  How much did he spend in total?"

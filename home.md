My name is Jacob and I teach mathematics.  On this page you will find links to materials from my classes that I've been teaching, 
blog posts about a variety of topics, and some of my other writing and production as time goes on.  
Currently, I have materials that address problems typically associated with introductory undergraduate mathematics or 
Quantitative Reasoning coursework, undergraduate or high-school Pre - Calculus materials, 
and high school or undergraduate Calculus materials.  

These materials seek to integrate open source technology to solve mathematical problems.

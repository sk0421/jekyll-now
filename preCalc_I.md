**Section I: Representing and Classifying Functions**

This is our introductory material.  Here, we want to remind students about the vocabulary of *functions* as a process of describing the 
interconnectedness of quantities.  We are not interested in the theory of functions, having students decide whether or not something is a function,
or memorization of a formal definition of a function.  Instead, we want to focus on representation of interrelatedness of quantities
in words, graphs, tables, and mathematical symbols.  Our primary goals in this section might be:

- Support students facility in moving between representations of functions
- Use Jupyter Notebooks to represent functions with words in markdown cells
- Use Jupyter Notebooks to represent functions with graphs with Python in matplotlib
- Use Jupyter Notebooks to represent functions with tables with Python in Pandas
- Use Jupyter Notebooks to represent functions with symbols with Python in Sympy
- Discriminate between Linear, Quadratic, Exponential, and Trigonometric Functions

### Materials

Here are some draft notebooks in the order that we've discussed problems this semester.  We are in the process of revising these materials, and they
are not meant to necessarily be used in presented order.

- [Notebook 1](https://github.com/DubMathematics/DubMathematics/blob/master/notebooks/section_I/notebook_I/pre_calc_1.ipynb): **Introduction to Jupyter notebook and Python I**. Here we use markdown cells, $\LaTeX$, numpy, and the matplotlib plotting library.  Students define and plot functions using numpy and matplotlib.  Using markdown cells and LaTeX, students learn to communicate answers about different functions.

- [Notebook 2](https://github.com/DubMathematics/DubMathematics/blob/master/notebooks/section_I/notebook_2/precalc_2.ipynb): **Introduction to Jupyter notebook and Python II**. In this notebook, students see some basic functionality of the Pandas library to create and load values as tables.  We show some built in plotting functionality of matplotlib with Pandas.  Additionally, students use the Sympy library to operate on functions symbolically.  A final problems demonstrates the use of user input and Sympy's plotting functionality.

- [Notebook 3](https://github.com/DubMathematics/DubMathematics/blob/master/notebooks/section_I/notebook_3/precalc_3_arithgeom.ipynb): **Functions with Integer Domains**: In this notebook, we introduce students to sequences in Python with `for` loops.  This is done in the context of simple versus compound interest problems.  A connection to the vocabulary of linear and exponential functions is important here.

- [Notebook 4](https://github.com/DubMathematics/DubMathematics/blob/master/notebooks/section_I/notebook_4/precalc_notebook_4.ipynb):  **Sequences, Functions, Populations**: In this notebook we extend the problems from simple and compound interest to problems involving population growth and fish harvesting.  We move from integer to real domains and find linear, exponential, and quadratic contexts evolve from the ecological context.  We would hope that students are able to recognize linear, quadratic, and exponential functions in a variety of guises at the end of this.

- [Notebook 5](https://github.com/DubMathematics/DubMathematics/blob/master/notebooks/section_I/notebook_5/precalc_notebook_5.ipynb)**Transformations of Functions**: In this notebook students experiment with sliders to understand various transformations of functions.

- [Notebook 6](https://github.com/DubMathematics/DubMathematics/blob/master/notebooks/section_I/notebook_6/trig_review.ipynb):  **Harmonic Motion I**: In this notebook we introduce problems involving harmonic motion in a variety of contexts.  Students connect these situations to graphs of sin and cos functions.  Further, the vocabulary of amplitude, frequency, period, and phase shift is introduced as a way to generate functional models of harmonic motion.

- [Notebook 7](): **Harmonic Motion II**: In this notebook we deepen our explorations of harmonic motion to problems of sound waves and harmonic analysis.  We explore the superposition principle as a way to model vibrations.  Students explore solutions to the wave equation and generate animations with Python to understand different sounds and rhythms.

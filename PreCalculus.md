# PreCalculus Overview

The PreCalculus materials derive from my work this semester teaching at The New School.  Before getting started, we recommend you install 
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) on your computer.  This is the easiest way to get started with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.  If you are a teacher, we recommend you sign up for 
both [Sagemathcloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com/#settings) and a [github](github.com) page.  These are important ways to share your work with students.

### [Section I: Representing and Classifying Functions](https://dubmathematics.github.io/DubMathematics/preCalc_I/)

In this section we first want to move between different representational strategies in the form of graphs and words, tables and symbols. This is the introductory work in Python, and students encounter `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `sympy` libraries.  We discuss some ideas around visualizations and customizations in `matplotlib`.  Mathematically, students are introduced to idealized models of linear, quadratic, exponential, and trigonometric functions.



### Section II: Modeling Data with Functions

In this section students use least squares regression to fit functions to data.  Students are introduced to `scikitlearn` in the final lesson
to understand the difference in the Machine Learning paradigm of big data and linear regression.

* [Non Linear Functions and Regression]()
* [Further Applications and Machine Learning with scikitlearn]()

### Section III: Modeling with Matrices

In this section students explore the use of matrices to model data.  We being by exploring some basic matric arithmetic applied to image manipulation.

* [Matrix Multiplication]()
* [Distance, Norms, and Matrices]()
* [Transformations and Trigonometry]()
* [Repeating Operations on Matrices]()

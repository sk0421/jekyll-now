title: Quantitative Reasoning
---



These materials derive from a semester experience at The New School teaching quantitiative reasoning.  Our goal was to expose students to some 
basic problem solving using technology.  We begin by using google sheets but quickly tranisition to using R as our language of choice.
We focus on exploratory data analysis and visualition.  You can use these materials using either Sagemathcloud, having students install and use
R Studio on their computer, or implementing an R kernel with your Jupyter notebook.

**[Section I: Introduction to Problem Solving]()**

Students use google spreadsheets to solve problems involving arithmetic and geometric sequences in the context of compound and simple interest.
We connect these ideas to the context of inflation and the Consumer price index with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Finally,
we introduce students to R.

**[Section II: Intro to Data Analysis and Visualization]()**

Students explore the capabilities of R and create their first R Markdown documents.  We use the default R color schemes and R color brewer together
with the barplot feature to make nice images in our first exploration.  Next, students explore built-in datasets from R with to customize a
barplot.  Finally, students load and visualize additional datasets including their earlier work with the Consumer Price Index and Inflation.

**[Section III: Case Studies]()

Using their new tools of data analysis and visualizations, students focus on a variety of cases where data might have been misleading.

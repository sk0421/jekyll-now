Please explore and use the material here and use as you would like.  This is the launching site for dubMathematics materials and our blog.  To make the most of the material here we recommend downloading and installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), and to [set up an R Kernel in your Jupyter notebooks](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer/jupyter-and-conda-r).  Additionally, we recommend teachers use [Sagemathcloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com/) to share and introduce this material to students.

## About Us

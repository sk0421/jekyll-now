My name is Jacob and I teach mathematics.  On this page you will find links to materials from my classes that I've been teaching, blog posts about a variety of topics, and some of my other writing and production as time goes on.  Currently, I have materials that address problems typically associated with introductory undergraduate mathematics or Quantitative Reasoning coursework, undergraduate or high-school Pre - Calculus materials, and high school or undergraduate Calculus materials.  These primarily seek to integrate open source technology to solve mathematical problems.

## Quantitative Reasoning Materials

These materials have been used across a variety of typical introductory classes at the undergraduate level.  I view these as appropriate activities for students who come from non-technical backgrounds and show diverse interests not necessarily in mathematics or science.  This semester these typically fall under some variation of Quantitative Reasoning courses.

## PreCalculus Materials

These materials are a result of this semesters PreCalculus course at The New School.  Students focused on using Jupyter notebooks and the Python computing language to solve problems in three primary areas; functions, data, and matrices.  

## Calculus Materials

These materials focus on topics from my Calculus course that I have taught for a number of years at The New School.  This class uses the Python computing language together with Jupyter notebooks to expose students to many introductory problems in calculus.  The materials are based on the historical development of the subject and we are very interested in the human uses of these concepts.

## Quantitative Reasoning

The material is drawn from a variety of classes that typically are a compulsory class for undergraduate students seeking to fulfill a mathematics requirement.
These materials focus on introductory work with data and technology.  First, students become familiar with markdown documents and spreadsheets with activities in
google sheets.  Next, students are introduced to the R language through some basic descriptive statistics.  These activities focus heavily on visualizing
datasets and communicating quantitative information visually.  Finally similar work discussing inferential statistics is discussed and students complete a final
project using R Studio and an R Markdown document.  

## [PreCalculus](https://my-myself-and-i.github.io/DubMathematics/PreCalculus/)

Our precalculus class covers functions, models, and systems.  We primarily utilize the [Python]() computer language in [Jupyter]() notebooks distributed
through [Sagemathcloud]() and run locally through [Anaconda]().  This material is broken into three sections.  Section I covers introductory material to representing 
functions with tables, graphs, equations, and words.  Section II introduces how we can model real world data with functions through linear and
non-linear regression in addition to a Machine Learning application with [scikitlearn]().  Section III discusses systems of equations and matrices,
initially discussing applications to computer vision, regression, and machine learning problems of preference ranking and handwriting recognition.

## Calculus

These calculus materials reflect my teaching at The New School for the past number of years.  The class is broken into three sections.
First, students discuss representation and summations to understand ancient problems of quadrature and then the definite integral of the moderns.
Second, students encounter problems around motion and rates of change as an introduction to differentiation.  Finally, these operations are connected
through our work with differential equations.

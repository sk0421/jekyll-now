**Section III: Modeling with Matrices**

In this section we extend our focus to systems of functional relationships and modeling data with matrices.  Matrices are introduce as 
ways to represent computer images and large arrays of data.  Students explore matrix arithmetic as a way to manipulate images
and to explore big datasets.  Connections are made to earlier problems involving Linear Regression as well as using trigonometric functions
to rotate images.

- [Notebook 3.1]():**Introduction to Matrices I**.  In this notebook, students are introduced to matrices with simple numpy arrays.  Addition, 
subtraction, and scalar multiplication are discussed.  Finally, students deepend their understanding of indexing matrices by performing
simple image loading, pixel masking, cropping and swapping.

- [Notebook 3.2](): **Introduction to Matrices II**.  Students solve simple 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 systems of equations with numpy and scipy.linalg
functions.  We connect this to larger problems with norms and distance in a matrix context.

- [Notebook 3.3](): **Matrices and Regression**. Students understand the connection between matrix multiplication and Linear Regression problems.
We also introduce the idea of LOESS regression.

- [Notebook 3.4](): **More Applications**.  Students explore applications of recommendation systems and computer vision in the Machine 
learning context to deepen their understanding of the applications of matrices and linear algebra.

- [Notebook 3.5](): **Eigenvectors and Eine Image Transformation**.  Students are introduced to the vocabulary of eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
We use these concepts to explore facial recognition on the computer.
